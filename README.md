# NHL Stats
This is an application to gather, display, and compare stats for National Hockey League players. The intent is for fantasy players and just fans in general to get a useful side-by-side comparison of different stats for different players.  

It is under construction right now (ob) as a full-stack application with a React frontend (`nhl-stats-app`) and a NodeJS/ExpressJS backend (`nhl-stats-api`).
